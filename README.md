# Quantum-Reinforcement-learning

I use parametrized quantum circuits to implement policy-gradient reinforcement learning using tensorflow-quantum and cirq. 

The present code is taken from tensorflow tutorial to solve the cartpole-v1 task from the OpenAI gym.I plan to extend this work to some other problems.
